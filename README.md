# my-desktop-starter-app

A starter app for writing Desktop applications using Electron framework and VueJS which uses Vuetify framework for UI, Axios for APIs, Lodash for common utilities and Vue-Route with Eslint, Babel and Prettier configured with Vue-CLI. Some custom components created by me on top of existing Vuetify components have also been added.
